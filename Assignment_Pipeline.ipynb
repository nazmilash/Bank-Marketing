    "**The Business Problem:**\n",
    "The objective of this project is to optimize a bank's telemarketing campaign. We aim to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (`y`) based on demographic and interaction data. Accurately identifying potential subscribers allows the bank to target resources efficiently, reducing marketing costs and increasing conversion rates.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Technical Approach:**\n",
    "This notebook implements a comprehensive Machine Learning pipeline to solve this **Binary Classification** problem. The workflow includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Exploration (EDA):** Analyzing distributions, handling missing values, and managing **Data Leakage** by removing the `duration` feature.\n",
    "2.  **Baseline Modeling:** Establishing performance benchmarks using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.\n",
    "3.  **Advanced Modeling:** Leveraging Ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost) and Hyperparameter Tuning to maximize predictive performance (AUC/F1-Score) on an **imbalanced dataset**.\n",

    "| **Campaign Contact Info** | contact, day, month, duration | Details about the last contact in the current campaign |\n",
    "| **Campaign History** | campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome | Information about past marketing interactions |\n",
    "| **Target Variable** | y | Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no) |\n",
    "\n",

    "- **job** (categorical): Type of job - admin, unknown, unemployed, management, housemaid, entrepreneur, student, blue-collar, self-employed, retired, technician, services\n",
    "- **marital** (categorical): Marital status - married, divorced, single (note: divorced includes widowed)\n",
    "- **education** (categorical): Education level - unknown, primary, secondary, tertiary\n",
    "- **default** (binary): Has credit in default? - yes/no\n",
    "- **balance** (numeric): Average yearly balance in euros\n",
    "- **housing** (binary): Has housing loan? - yes/no\n",
    "- **loan** (binary): Has personal loan? - yes/no\n",

    "**2. Last Contact Information (4 features):**\n",
    "- **contact** (categorical): Contact communication type - unknown, telephone, cellular\n",
    "- **day** (numeric): Last contact day of the month\n",
    "- **month** (categorical): Last contact month of year - jan, feb, mar, ..., nov, dec\n",
    "- **duration** (numeric): Last contact duration in seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Campaign History (3 features):**\n",
    "- **campaign** (numeric): Number of contacts performed during this campaign for this client (includes last contact)\n",
    "- **pdays** (numeric): Number of days passed after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (-1 means client was not previously contacted)\n",
    "- **previous** (numeric): Number of contacts performed before this campaign for this client\n",
    "- **poutcome** (categorical): Outcome of previous marketing campaign - unknown, other, failure, success\n",

    "- **y** (binary): Has the client subscribed to a term deposit? - yes/no\n",

    "**Key Considerations:**\n",
    "- The dataset exhibits **class imbalance** - fewer positive (subscription) cases than negative cases\n",
    "- The **duration** feature represents **data leakage** (it's only known after the call) and will be excluded from the predictive model\n",
    "- Multiple contacts per client provide valuable insights into campaign effectiveness\n",
